The base covariates originate from the MEDSL "2018 election context" file:
\url{https://github.com/MEDSL/2018-elections-unoffical/blob/master/election-context-2018.md}.
The variables `geo_group`, `longitude`, `latitude`, and `predicted_turnout`
are additions described above.

\description{
A county-level dataset (U.S.) with voter turnout and sociodemographic covariates.
}
\details{
The dataset is based on the MIT Election Lab "2018 Election Analysis dataset" file, with four additions: (1) `turnout`, calculated as the number of votes cast divided by the total population, (2) `geo_group`, a coarse geographic grouping variable for the counties, (3) county centroid coordinates (`longitude`, `latitude`), and (4) `predicted_turnout`,
which contains leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) predictions from a
random forest model. See Details for more information on `predicted_turnout`.


The variable `predicted_turnout` is generated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). For each county \(i = 1, \dots, n\), a random forest model is fit on the remaining \(n-1\) counties with `turnout` as the outcome and all available *non-geographic* covariates as predictors. The fitted model is then used to predict turnout for the held-out county \(i\). Geographic features are excluded from the predictor set to avoid leaking spatial information into the prediction target. Concretely, identifiers and geographic variables (e.g., `state`, `county`, `fips`, `division`, `region`, `geo_group`, `longitude`, `latitude`) are excluded from the predictor set.
